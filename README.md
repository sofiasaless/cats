# Gatuxos CRUD

This is a reinterpretation of the initial project "Cats", where i projected my first CRUD (create, read, update, delete) using Java, Spring Boot Framework, MySQL Database, and now React.

## What's is missing?

- [x] Host API and Database for effective CRUD functioning.
- [ ] Adjusting the entry of the age of the Cat object. The age must be entered from the Cat's date of birth and not from the current age. (Need to fix both in the API and in the front-end)
- [x] Remake eventually all the front-end work using ReactJs Library.
- [ ] Add Bootstrap for the styles.
- [ ] "About" page with credits for the images used.
